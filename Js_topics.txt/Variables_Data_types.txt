Variables

A variable is an identifier that points to a memory location where data is stored. The value in a variable can change during the execution of a program. 

Declaration: The process of creating a variable, often involving specifying its data type and a unique name (identifier).
Assignment: The process of storing a specific value in a declared variable.
Naming Rules: While specific rules vary by programming language (e.g., Python uses snake_case, Java uses camelCase), common constraints include:
Must start with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.
Cannot start with a digit.
Cannot contain spaces or special characters.
Cannot be a reserved keyword in the language.
Names are often case-sensitive. 


Data Types

Data types determine the kind of values a variable can hold, the amount of memory it uses, and the operations that can be performed on it. They are generally categorized into primitive and non-primitive (or reference) types. 
Common Primitive Data Types
These represent single, simple values. 
Integer (int): Whole numbers (positive and negative), e.g., 42, -5.
Floating-Point (float, double): Numbers with a fractional part (decimals), e.g., 3.14, 9.99.
Boolean (bool): Logical values representing either true or false.
Character (char): A single character, letter, or symbol.
String: A sequence of characters, typically used for text, e.g., "Hello, World!". 

Common Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These store collections of data or more complex entities. 
Arrays: Ordered lists of values, accessed by an index.
Objects: Collections of key-value pairs, used to store more complex, structured data.
Functions: Reusable blocks of code that can be stored and executed.
